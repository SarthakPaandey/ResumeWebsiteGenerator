  <h3>True Positive Inc.</h3>
  <h4>Author of the Machine Learning Engineering book</h4>
  <p>September 2019 – Present (5 years 1 month)</p>
  <p>Quebec, Canada</p>
  <p>"If you intend to use machine learning to solve business problems at scale, I'm delighted you got your hands on this book."</p>
  <p>—Cassie Kozyrkov, Chief Decision Scientist at Google</p>
  <p>"Foundational work about the reality of building machine learning models in production. Comes at the right time when companies start to see through the AI hype, realizing it takes a conscious engineering effort and best practices to make machine learning work. Another great book from Andriy!”</p>

  <h3>CEO and Author of The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book</h3>
  <p>January 2019 – Present (5 years 9 months)</p>
  <p>Quebec, Canada</p>
  <p>Peter Norvig, Research Director at Google, co-author of AIMA, the most popular AI textbook in the world: "Burkov has undertaken a very useful but impossibly hard task in reducing all of machine learning to 100 pages. He succeeds well in choosing the topics — both theory and practice — that will be useful to practitioners, and for the reader who understands that this is the first 100 (or actually 150) pages you will read, not the last, provides a solid introduction to the field." </p>
