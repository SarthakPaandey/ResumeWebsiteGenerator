  <h2>Machine Learning Lead at TalentNeuron</h2>
  <h3>Greater Quebec City Metropolitan Area</h3>
  <h4>February 2023 - Present (1 year 8 months)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Leading a team of Machine Learning developers working with gigabytes of talent marketplace data.</li>
    <li>Using machine learning (deep/shallow, LLMs, classification, generative AI, clustering, topic modeling), regular expressions, Python, MySQL, scikit-learn, and PyTorch.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Released on Amazon, B&N, and Leanpub.</li>
    <li>"Burkov has undertaken a very useful but impossibly hard task in reducing all of machine learning to 100 pages. He succeeds well in choosing the topics — both theory and practice — that will be useful to practitioners, and for the reader who understands that this is the first 100 (or actually 150) pages you will read, not the last, provides a solid introduction to the field." —Peter Norvig, Research Director at Google, co-author of AIMA, the most popular AI textbook in the world</li>
    <li>"The breadth of topics the book covers is amazing for just 100 pages (plus few bonus pages!). Burkov doesn't hesitate to go into the math equations: that's one thing that short books usually drop. I really liked how the author explains the core concepts in just a few words. The book can be very useful for newcomers in the field, as well as for old-timers who can gain from such a broad view of the field." —Aurélien Géron, Senior AI Engineer, author of the bestseller Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow</li>
